    </h2>
    <p>
        This is a Python library for analysis for the Galvanostatic Charge Discharge <b>(GCD)</b> curves of two-electrode, symmetrical supercapacitors. It provides an easy and standardised way to quickly extract useful information from the GCD data, especially the <b>capacitance</b> and the <b>ESR </b>of the supercapacitor and how they evolve over time, with multiple options offered to suit the need of scientific investigations of supercapacitors. 

<br>
<br>

In this library, the capacitance is calculated via linear fitting the second half of the discharging slope in each charging/discharging cycle. For <b>gravimetric capacitance (F g^-1)</b>:

<p align="center">
C_g = (m_1 + m_2)/{m_1 m_2} * I * dV</center>
</p>

<br>


For <b>non-gravimetric capacitance (F)</b>:

<p align="center">
C = I * dV 
</p>

<br>


The <b>ESR (Î©)</b> is calculated using the voltage drop:

<p align="center">
ESR = V_drop / (2I) 
</p>

<br>
<br>

An illustration of how the GCD data is analysed is shown below:

        This python library offers means to analyse GCD data in the format of text files, which can be directlt exported from electrochemistry software such as <code>EC Labs</code>. <b>The file has to have two and only two coloumns of data, with the first coloumn being time (s), and the second coloumn being Voltage (V).</b> (It is intended to extended the code to enable loading from csv files and/or files with multiple coloumns of data). The documentation includes two parts: means for loading data into the Supercap class and methods within the Superclass.

## <a href="#sub_TOC"><b>Load_capacitor</b><i>(pathway, mass_ls = False, current = False, row_skip = False, ESR_method = True, setting = False, cap_norm = False)</i></a> 
This function loads the text file specified on the pathway into the <b>Supercap</b> class ,where capacitance and ESR analysis will be carried out. All relevant information can be extracted from the init function.


### Notes
---
This function aims to be a fast reader for simpley formatted text files. <b>The first coloumn of the file is assumed to be time (s), and the second coloumn is assumed to be Voltage (V) for the GCD analysis.</b>

<br>

Future development of the code will aim to include loading of csv files and/or files where the location of the data coloumns can be specified. 

### Parameters
---

#### Arguments
1. <b>pathway : <i>file, str, or pathlib.Path</i></b> <br>
    File, filename of the text file to read. Note that if the library is not allocated in the same directory as the file, the pathway to the file has to be given. For <b>``` current=False```</b>, current will be directly read from the filename (i.e. the fielname has to include the current followed by <code>'_mA'</code> and seperated by <code>'_'</code>, <code>'/'</code> or it is the first component of the filename). For more details, refer to the Examples section.


2. <b>mass_ls : <i>list, [[measurements of m1], [measurements of m2]], optional</i></b> <br>
   A list specifying the mass of each electrode in the format as shwon above. Multiple measurements for each electrode should be included for calculation of the uncertainty of the data. All masses should be recorded in <b>mg</b>. If mass_ls = False, a non-gravimetric capacitanc will be calculated and the function returns <i><code>[[False, False], [False, False]]</code></i> for the <code>.masses</code> method in the resulting Supercap entity (more details for extracting data from the Supercap class in <a href="#__init__">Supercap class>>init</a>


3. <b>current : <i> float, optional</i></b><br>
   If <b><code>current = False</code></b>, the current value will be directly read from the filename given that it is supplied in the format as specified above in the pathway section. If the current is not included the filename, it should be specified in the form of <code>current =<i>specified_current</i></code>


4. <b>row_skip : <i>int, optional</i></b><br>
   Number of the rows of headers to skip in the txt files. If <b><code>row_skip = False</code></b>, a prompt will ask for rows to skip for the file. Enter <code>row_skip = 0</code> if no rows need to be skipped.

5. <b>ESR_method : <i>int, optional</i></b><br>

For all methods available please refer to the next session <a href="#method_table">ESR_method</a>. <code>ESR_setting = False</code> will return <code>.esr_ls</code> as <b>False</b> in the Supercap class. Available ESR_methods are: <code>ESR_methods = True, False, 1, 101, 2, 201. </code>


6. <b>setting : <i>float, optional</i></b><br>
   For <code>ESR_methods = True, 1, or 2 </code>, <code>setting = False</code>. For <code>ESR_methods = 101 or 201 </code>, setting is required as the number of points n/second derivative cut off point needed for the constant point method and the constant derivative method, respectively. If <code>ESR_methods = 101 or 201 </code> but <code>setting = False</code>, the function will promt the user to choose a specific value for the ESR analysis before proceeding. 


7. <b>cap_norm : <i>bool, optional</i></b><br>
   It is by default that the gravimetric capacitance is calculated. By using <code>cap_norm = False</code> or <code>mass_ls = False</code> , a non-gravimetric capacitance will be calculated.

### Notes
